The paper "Software quality and dependability concepts, terminology - Software Complexity and Maintainability" is a discussion focused on the main concepts of software quality and dependability, as well as highlighting the importance of maintainability in the current industry. 
We also take a further look at how code complexity affects software maintainability, especially in large systems, and how that reflects on costs, ending with how this results could be applied to the industry and what needs to be researched further.

Also in this repository we can find all the dynamic software testing performed on a matrix algorithm. We cover everything from black box testing with boundary value analysis to white box testing with control flow and data flow testing.
